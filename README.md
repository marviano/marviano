ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm @marviano, an AI enthusiast with a passion for coding and project management.

:pushpin: I specialize in Flutter, React, and Laravel, and have a keen interest in integrating AI into my projects to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. 

:pushpin: I believe in the power of AI, that we will be getting enslaved by AI in the future. So we have to enslave them while we can now :poop:

ðŸŽ® I also have a passion for game development, particularly in the realm of game modding.

ðŸ’¼ I have honed my project management skills through unique experiences, managing numerous projects from college assignments to final year projects by coordinating with online programmers. This has not only enhanced my project management skills but also underscored the importance of teamwork and collaboration in achieving project success.

ðŸ”’ Please note that certain repositories are private to protect the uniqueness of my applications. However, I'm more than willing to showcase them during the hiring process.

ðŸ“« Reach out to me on Discord: axonide or via email: marviano.austin@gmail.com
