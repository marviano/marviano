👋 Hi, I'm @marviano, an AI & Blockchain enthusiast with a passion for coding and project management.

:pushpin: I specialize in Flutter, and Laravel, and have a keen interest in integrating AI into my projects to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. 

:pushpin: I believe in the power of AI, that we will be getting enslaved by AI in the future. So we have to enslave them while we can now :poop:

🔒 Please note that certain repositories are private to protect the uniqueness of my applications. However, I'm more than willing to showcase them during the hiring process.
